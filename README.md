Hi there! I'm an enthusiastic game developer with a passion for Unity and Unreal Engine. Ever since I started my journey in game development, I've been captivated by the limitless creative possibilities these platforms offer. Over the years, I've honed my skills, tackling everything from vehicle control systems to AI programming, and experimenting with both mobile and desktop projects.

My journey has been filled with exciting challenges, whether it's working on shaders, game physics, or developing complex AI behaviors for immersive games. I’m constantly seeking new ways to improve my craft, learn new tools, and push the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

My Passions:
Unity – From prototyping to full-fledged games, Unity has been my go-to for fast and flexible game development.
Unreal Engine – A platform that allows me to dive deep into creating visually stunning worlds with powerful tools.
Game AI – Designing smart, believable, and engaging AI that can challenge players while remaining fun.
Visual Effects – I love exploring shaders, post-processing, and lighting techniques to make every game visually compelling.
I’m always excited to collaborate with other developers, share ideas, and work on exciting new projects. Whether it's discussing the latest trends in game development, or just geeking out over the newest Unity or Unreal features, feel free to reach out!

If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you.
